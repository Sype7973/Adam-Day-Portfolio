# Adam-Day-Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio that I could use to showcase my work to potential employers.
- I built this project because I wanted to create a portfolio that I could use to showcase my experience using HTML, CSS, and React. It is also a great way to showcase my previous projects.
- It allows me to have a one stop shop for all of my projects and contact information.
- I learn't a lot about React and how to use it to create a portfolio. I also learn't how to use React Router to create a multi-page application.
